description=QuickRectangleCreator allows you to create a rectangle quickly and easily, preset sizes, snap to grid and rotate on the fly.
version=0.5

about=This is a rework of the QRectangleCreator plugin. It allows you to create a rectangle with the specified width, length and rotation. The plugin also allows you to snap the rectangle to the grid. The plugin is designed to be more user friendly and to have more features than the original plugin. It makes use of the mouse wheel to rotate the rectangles on the fly. Rectangle dimensions can be saved and recalled quickly through a drop down.
